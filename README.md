# Launch
The script is based on minikube, (at least the final service tunnel), i.e., use \
    `minikube start`
\and afterwards:\
    `myClscript.sh`
\
The docker container runs a uvicorn webserver.


## Usage
The server is available on \
    `http://127.0.0.1:7080/`
\For the REST-API (basic FastApi example)
